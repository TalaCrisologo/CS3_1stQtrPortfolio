# **State Of the Nation Address 2025 🇵🇭**

### **Interesting Parts of SONA ━━━━━━━━━━━**
1. President Marcos stating PhilHealth now covers kidney transplants and that money has been allocated for cancer prevention.  
2. Philippine Sports Commission opening its track and field for public use, as well as a program that supports active lifestyles in school.  

### **Weird Parts of SONA ━━━━━━━━━━━**
1. President Marcos promising that a kilogram of rice will be sold at 20 pesos without farmers losing money.  
   This was weird because a kilo of rice is currently priced at PHP 35–50. Marcos is essentially promising to have stores that sell rice at PHP 20.  
   The prices never really went down; he just buys them for the same price and sells it at a lower price.

### **Reflection ━━━━━━━━━━━**
I think that many of the projects that President Marcos stated in his address are relevant and important to our country right now. Projects such as the ARAL program, increased funding for PhilHealth, and the free mental health services for students and teachers are good things to focus on as our country progresses. However, there are some projects that I remain skeptical of, like the PHP 20/kilo rice, because I don't think it is being implemented properly. I think that the government's priorities are in the right place, but there are many promises yet to be fulfilled, and there are also pressing issues such as the safety of our farmers and fishermen.

There were also many protests that happened during Marcos' speech. Even though Marcos aims to lower the price of meat and rice, he still didn't make any move to deal with the rising inflation. Marcos had many warnings towards the corrupt officials that he called out in his speech, but had no mention of Sara Duterte or her impeachment. I'm glad that there are many well-meaning projects, but we have yet to see if the government can deliver all of its promises properly.

**Word of the day:** *Unlad*.
